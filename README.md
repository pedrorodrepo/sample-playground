# Kotlin Playground ðŸ§ª

This repository is a **playground** to test and practice everything I learn in my Kotlin course. Itâ€™s a place to write small snippets, apply concepts, and experiment without the pressure of a real project.

## ðŸš€ What is it?

- A personal sandbox for Kotlin experiments.
- Ideal for trying out language features, syntax, and APIs.
- Great for reinforcing learning with hands-on practice.
